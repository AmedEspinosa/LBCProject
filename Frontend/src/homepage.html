        Art Place is a free service that allows users to upload their original artwork for free! <br>
        If you are an aspiring or well established artist, this site was designed for you! <br>
        It is often hard for new artists to establish their reputation and here at Art Place <br>
        we wanted to provide all artists a place to share their work publicly. <br>

        Feel free to explore and create at your heart's desire! <br>
        We would like all new users to know that while on your account page you can: <br>
        <br>
        Upload Art <br>
        View All Of Your Uploads <br>
        Edit the attributes of an artwork that has been uploaded <br>
        Delete artwork you have previously uploaded <br>
        <br>
        Please excuse our appearance as we will be regularly updating our new page. <br>
        Some future features we hope to have soon include: <br>
        <br>
        The ability to view other user's art <br>
        Buy and sell artworks via the site <br>
        The ability to like someone's art and post a comment <br>
